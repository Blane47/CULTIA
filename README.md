## 📌 About the Project

**CULTIA** is an AI-powered digital platform designed to address the growing loss of cultural knowledge among young people in Cameroon.

Cameroon has over **250 ethnic groups**, each with unique traditions, folklore, values, and history. Much of this knowledge has traditionally been preserved through **oral storytelling**, which is now declining due to urbanization, globalization, and Western-centered digital content.

CULTIA uses **modern software technologies and Artificial Intelligence** to digitize, preserve, and teach Cameroonian culture in an interactive and engaging way.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Despite Cameroon’s rich cultural diversity, there is **no centralized, interactive digital platform** dedicated to preserving and teaching indigenous cultural knowledge.

As a result:
- Young Cameroonians grow up disconnected from their roots
- Cultural values are gradually lost
- Schools provide limited indigenous cultural education
- Digital platforms rarely reflect local identity

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

CULTIA provides:
- 📚 Structured cultural learning content
- 📖 Digitized folklore and storytelling
- 🤖 An AI-powered chatbot for interactive learning
- 📝 Quizzes to assess understanding
- 📊 Progress tracking for learners
- 🛠️ Admin tools for content validation
